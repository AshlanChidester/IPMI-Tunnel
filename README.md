# IPMI-Tunnel

**This script establishes an SSH tunnel through a bastion host to forward specific ports to an IPMI host.** 

This allows you to manage IPMI-enabled servers remotely even if they are behind firewalls or on inaccessible networks.

**Key Features:**

* **Port Forwarding:** Forwards a configurable list of ports to the IPMI host.
* **Bastion Host Support:** Enables secure access to the IPMI host through a secure jump server.
* **Loopback Interface:** Utilizes a loopback interface alias for local port binding.

Support by visiting www.AshlanChidester.com and consider buying one of many great technical manuals.
